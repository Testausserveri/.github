Testausserveri is an open community for all young people who are passionate about coding, ethical hacking, and technology in general. We are working together to develop a variety of interesting projects that you can check out here.

We aim towards a low threshold for anyone to [join our discussions on Discord](https://discord.testausserveri.fi). Our warm community encourages us to develop ourselves in this field.

Our community is a registered non-profit association in Finland. ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡®

_Members can't create new repositories on their own but they can ask a member of the board to do it for them._
